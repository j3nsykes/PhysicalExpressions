# PhysicalExpressions
### A teaching module builing on Data Visualisation techniques and mapping these to physical outputs such as motors, lights and plotters. 

Workshops involved techniques such as serial communication, OSC, mapping of data to kinetic outputs and generating traces of data with vertex lines. 

The tools used were Processing and Arduino. The general intention of the module was to allow students time to explore joining up and prototyping techniques around graphics, physical interaction and larger scale work.
